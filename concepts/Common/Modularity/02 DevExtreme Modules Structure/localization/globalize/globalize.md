The Globalize package is outdated and potentially insecure. Reports from the Snyk security checker highlight vulnerabilities associated with this package.

Use Globalize at your own risk. In v25.1, we will remove Globalize from our installation, templates, and demos. We recommend switching to Intl for a more secure solution.
